# Uber-Clone
This is an android application designed after being inspired by the uber mobile application. It provides all the facilities and allows to login either as in rider mode or driver mode. If login as rider mode , it shows the rider the option to take a cab to reach the destination and hence book the taxi. The rider can also cancel the uber ride. The driver mode allows the driver to see the nearest rider and pick him/her up to drop to desired location.
